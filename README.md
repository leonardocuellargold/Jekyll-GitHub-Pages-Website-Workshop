   ```

2. **Navigate into the folder**:

   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   If your template uses a `Gemfile`, install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

4. **Serve the site locally**:
   Run the following command to preview your site:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

5. **Customize Your Content**:
   - Update the `_config.yml` file with your personal information (name, email, social links).
   - Modify or add Markdown files (`.md`) for your resume and blog content.
   - Use Jekyllâ€™s default folder structure for blog posts (`_posts` folder).

6. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   Push your changes to GitHub to make your site live:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

   Then, enable GitHub Pages under your repository settings to deploy your site at `https://username.github.io`.

### **Step 4: Personalize Your Resume + Blog**
Each template provides different customization options, allowing you to add a personal touch to your online portfolio. Make sure to:
- Update your resume with your work experience, education, and skills.
- Add blog posts to share your thoughts, projects, or interests.
